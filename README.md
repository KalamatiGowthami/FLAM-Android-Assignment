# FLAM-Android-Assignment

I have solved two question in the first android assignment link.

1. LRUCache.py --> the code is written in python, it has a few test cases also. it is self runnable, just run it to see the output for sample testcases ( no dependencies are required).
2. MyHashMap.cpp ---> the code is in CPP and it also has a few test cases,  also is self runnable.( no dependencies are required)

### I haven't worked with web development and Graphical stuff, but I am a fast learner, I can learn as I go in that area too.
